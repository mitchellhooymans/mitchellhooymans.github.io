Recently, I had the opportunity to return to my old university to speak on a panel for current science students. It was a chance to reflect on my own journey, one that wasn't exactly a straight line, and share some of the lessons I've learned along the way. From switching degrees to discovering a passion for the 'extreme' universe, here are some thoughts on navigating a career in science.

## The Pivot: Finding the Right Path

My university experience actually started in a Bachelor of IT. I did that for a year, but I eventually realized it just wasn't the right fit for me at the time. I took a break, and during that time away, I read a fascinating book about astronomy that completely sparked a change in direction.

I returned to university around 2020 with a new focus: a double degree in Computer Science and Physics. Toward the end of my undergrad, I knew I wanted to pursue astrophysics, so I completed my Honours with Dr. Michael Cowley researching supermassive black holes. That path led me to where I am today, at UQ, undertaking a PhD in Astrophysics. My research now focuses on the 'extreme' end of the universe: specifically, how massive stars explode and collapse into black holes, which then collide with other black holes to form the gravitational waves we detect today.

## Thriving in Science Studies

Looking back at my time as an undergraduate, there are two main tips I always give to students who want to do more than just survive their degree.
First: Master your internal deadlines. Don't leave things until the last minute. When you receive an assignment, allocate specific blocks of time to work on it immediately. I always recommend setting a personal deadline a few days earlier than the actual due date; it gives you that essential buffer to review your work without the '11:59 PM' stress.

Second: Be brave enough to ask for help. Science is a collaborative effort. Universities have brilliant tutors and academics, as well as excellent support services. Utilizing those resources isn't a sign that you're struggling; it's a sign that you're a smart student who knows how to succeed.

## Essential Skills for the Modern Scientist

Beyond the coursework, there are technical and professional skills that are absolutely critical for a career in science.

Professionally, it comes down to **Time Management**. It sounds simple, but it's the foundation of everything. It's not just about knowing when assessments are due; it's about proactively scheduling time to relax and unwind. You can't do good science if you're burnt out.

Technically, and I'll admit I'm biased here, my top recommendation is to **learn how to code well**. Modern science, especially astrophysics, is 'computer-first.' I don't know a single person in my department who doesn't spend at least part of their day coding. It is the universal tool of the modern scientist.

## The Creative Frontier

What excites me most about this field is that science is a creative frontier. You get to explore incredibly interesting ideas and constantly challenge yourself, but more importantly, you get to work on things you are genuinely passionate about. Science allows you to push the absolute boundaries of human knowledge, to explore concepts that no one else has quite mastered yet. It's a very different, very exciting way to spend your day-to-day life.

## University as an Operating System

I see university as being about far more than just imparting subject knowledge. Its real value for your future career is that it teaches you *how to learn*. Beyond the equations, you are learning how to manage your time, how to communicate complex ideas to others, and how to master the technical tools you'll need in the workforce. University provides the 'operating system' that allows you to be ready for whatever job the future throws at you.

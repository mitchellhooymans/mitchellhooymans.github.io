Creative Easter Egg Ideas for your Profile Photo
================================================

1. The "Boop" Effect
------------------
Make the photo interactive so that clicking exactly on your nose plays a subtle "boop!" sound effect and makes the image lightly squish and bounce back using CSS transforms.

2. "Deal With It" Sunglasses
----------------------------
Clicking the photo (or double-clicking) drops pixelated "Deal With It" sunglasses onto your face from the top of the screen, accompanied by a brief snippet of retro music or a UI color change.

3. Cursor-Tracking Googly Eyes
------------------------------
Add a subtle overlay where your eyes in the portrait realistically follow the user's cursor around the screen. If the cursor gets too close, the eyes could cross!

4. 8-Bit / Pixel Art Transformation
-----------------------------------
Entering the Konami Code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) on the keyboard transitions the high-res photo into a retro 8-bit pixel art version of yourself.

5. Gravity Failure
------------------
Clicking the profile photo 5 times in rapid succession causes it to "detach" from the page layout and fall to the bottom of the browser window, bouncing a few times with a physics effect. It can snap back when clicked again.

6. The "Thanos Snap" (Particle Disintegration)
----------------------------------------------
Shift-clicking the photo causes it to dissolve into a cloud of particles that blow away in the wind, only to reconstruct itself 3 seconds later.

7. Hidden Content Reveal
------------------------
Make the photo draggable. If the user drags the photo out of its frame, it reveals a secret message, a link to a hidden "behind-the-scenes" page, or a picture of your pet underneath.

8. Hold-to-Age / Filter
-----------------------
Hovering or clicking and holding on the photo for more than 5 seconds triggers a CSS filter change—either aging you dramatically, turning you into a pencil sketch, or revealing an alternate funny photo.

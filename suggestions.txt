# Comprehensive Website Improvement Plan

## 1. Visual & Immersive Additions
*Enhancing the "Cosmic" Theme*
- **Custom Cosmic Cursor**: Implement a glowing star or crosshair cursor that trails stardust or light as it moves.
- **Parallax Backgrounds**: Add a 3D depth effect to background stars and nebula layers that move at different speeds on scroll.
- **Animated Gradient Borders**: Use moving gradients for "glass" card borders to make them feel active and premium.
- **Scroll Progress Bar**: A slim, gradient bar at the top of the window to indicate reading progress.
- **Dark Mode Refinements**: Ensure high contrast for text overlaid on star fields (already improved, but check all pages).

## 2. New Pages & Sections
*Expanding Content Offerings*
- **"/now" Page**: A high-level update on current focus, projects, and learning goals (inspired by Derek Sivers).
- **"/uses" Page**: A standard developer/photographer page listing hardware (laptop, camera) and software stack.
- **"The Lab"**: A dedicated page for experimental code, half-finished ideas, and raw data visualizations—showing the "messy" side of research.
- **"/guestbook"**: A place for visitors to leave public comments (using **Giscus** or **Utterances** for static sites).
- **Dark Sky Photography Map**: An interactive map (Leaflet.js) showing pin locations of your astrophotography shots.

## 3. Advanced Functionalities
*Improving User Experience & Utility*
- **Site-wide Search**: Client-side search (Lunr.js/Fuse.js) across blog posts, tutorials, and research.
- **Publication Tracker**: A script (Python/GitHub Actions) to auto-fetch your papers from arXiv/ADS and update `research.html`.
- **RSS Feed**: Crucial for technical blogs so readers can subscribe to updates.
- **Auto-generated Table of Contents**: Sticky TOC for long tutorials (like Python for Astrophysics).
- **Lazy Loading**: Apply `loading="lazy"` to all images for performance.
- **Code Snippet Enhancements**: Add "Copy to Clipboard" buttons and syntax highlighting (Prism.js).

## 4. Interactive Astrophysics Visualizations
*High-Impact WebGL/JS Projects*
- **Black Hole Lensing**: A WebGL simulation where users drag a black hole over a background starfield to see gravitational lensing.
- **Solar System Builder**: A simple N-body integrator where users "fling" planets into orbit.
- **3D Star Cluster**: A rotatable Three.js visualization of a globular cluster.
